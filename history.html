  <h2>Humble  origins</h2>
  <p>
    It all begin in a humnle 2006 in the city of Baldur's Gate,in the pretisgeous polytechnic of Baldur's gate. 3 unlikely companions met each other in a programming class. Somehow someway, They managed to form an unbreakable bond with their shared passions to become a well recognised game development studio
    <br><br>
    "Hernie" known as Hrarnenarnegan ZarZar was a well known helper of the community a very supportive folk in the religion of yaoshi a life domain god which he happened to worship, "Hernie" is a reliable individual that you can trust through the thick and thin of things.
    <br><br>
    Minthara though was not as popular as the others is a very prominent fighter winning many martial tournaments so it really was a huge surprise someone like her ended up finding their passion in game development instead which initially started in a programming course due to boredom and wanting to learn something new.
    <br><br>
    Pam when joining the course also had a passion and side hobby in robotics and scavenging junk from the scrapyard, this would one day bare fruit when she discovered a robot body discarded and unfinished by the junk, after a personal project and 2 years later. Pam has restored the robot to functionality by 2019 and this robot will be later known as AX0L0TL who gained sentience and learned many curiosities of the world around them.
    <br><br>
    AX0L0TL is a robotic mech that is very curious about the world,he really has alot to learn about society and has learnt and gained a hobby in gardening which is actually pretty cool. AX0L0TL is second to none in logic problems with his strong processors plus GPU specs whihch was no small cost to obtain, AX0L0TL is a good hearted robot even if lacking one and trusted partner in dev team.
  </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>WAMBAM STUDIOS</h2>
  <p>
    After 3 years and finishing the course, the 4 friends decided to give it a shot, forming WAMBAM studios due to Pam and Minthara shared appreciation in boxing and "Hernie" being inspired by a WII game known as "punch out WII",They were quick at work and still needed to learn alot of things to succeed in the world of game development, many troubles and woes were experienced during the creations of their hit game
"Mad Scientist Go shopping" renowned indie game where players build their decks to great success to fight each other ingame and RULE THE WORLD.Alot of financial issues were faced during development with blood sweat and tears put forward to finish the product with each member working twice as hard to fund their project to the finish line with a big gamble involved near the end and finally in 2021, Their magnum opus so far has been finished.
    <br><br>
    Many times has passed already with their other projects achiving relatively great success. WAMBAM STUDIOS will persevere on and keep on going even through thick and muddy roads.Eventually,the dev team will expand and we will produce even bigger scope of games that was a pipe dream 5 years ago in the course, Join this small development team through their development process and support them on thier future works to bring everyone quality games for all to enjoy. There may not me much history now since only 5 years has passed so lets make more merry stories and tales and grow together as we go higher and higher into the ring!
