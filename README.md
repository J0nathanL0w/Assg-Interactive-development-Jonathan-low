# Assg-Interactive-development-Jonathan-low
A repository for my interactive development project
My project is a ID project for a fictional website for a fictional company called WAMBAM studios

The purpose of this project is to create a website where the studio can create a dedicated platform for the fans of their games as well as sell their products such as games or merch without occuring any other platform fees like steam website taking a cut from people buying games or apple taking a cut from buying from the apple store

The website also includes the origin as well as members of the development team in case people are curious of who they are as well as show games they are developing at the moment

Design process:
The website is essientially for the fans of the studio who vividly enjoys the work of the creators and want to best support them or gain more insight on how they were created

a user story would be
As a fan of their games, I want to see the best way I would be able to support them so that I can enjoy more of their products

As a new player of their games, I want their website to be easy and responsive to interact with so that I will be interested in supporting their endeavors

I have already shared the wireframes in an earlier check in so I will not be providing any urls due to me not being able to find out how

Features:
The buy here button in products glow green when you press it to let the users know that their input has been registered

The feedback form will show the name that the user has typed to show that their feedback has been successfully implemented

There is a nav bar that brings user to other pages

Features left to implement:
For the feedback form there is definitely more stuff to add such as limits as well as more validators to make sure people cannot just submit gibberish and probably storing the data so it can be used later?

another feature would probably be letting users log in with their account they  used to access the website if I know how to do that

Technologies used:
I used replit to develop the project as since it is what we learned during lesson time how to use so naturally it was the most natural one for me since I could not learn using another website in time such as studio VC
https://replit.com/~
I also used w3 schools to help me to get some of the code since I did not know how to do those myself and to save time I learned how to make them myself using this website and with their help it really saved alot of time 
https://www.w3schools.com/

Testing:
Troubles I found during the project was trying to solve code that just was not working for various reasons such as miswritten code or just me being bad at this coding at the time of doing the website creation

another trouble that occured that while testing was occuring the pages to other parts of the website would not load so after several test shooting I then had to code the rest of the page without seeing the end result and yet somehow despite how harrowing that was, it turned out fine sorta with some few hiccups on the way

testing went fine after all those occured my website is not too fancy due to my limited experience and I am fine with that currently and I am pretty sastisfied with what I accomplished in little time I made all the links are working as of checking it right now as I am writing this
